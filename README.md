# Project Euler

Here are my solutions to the problems from [ProjectEuler](https://projecteuler.net/about). This is just an console application with a class for each problem. I added a stopwatch to the algorithms so you can see how fast, or more likely slow, my solutions are.

For all of my helper methods like IsPrime() I added unit tests of which you can find the results here:

[![MSTest Tests](https://gist.github.com/jjs98/be9c4d1483fe85c60e715ed232e1df02/raw/badge.svg)](https://gist.github.com/jjs98/ProjectEuler)

I used [publish-unit-test-result-action](https://github.com/EnricoMi/publish-unit-test-result-action) to publish my test results.

Feel free to comment on my solutions ^^
